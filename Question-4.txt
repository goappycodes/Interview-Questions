Four different options to save data are:

1) Shared Preferences - Saved the data in device files area in xml format. Stores data in key - value pairs
2) Database - SQLite -  Extra light db for storing data in MYSQL format by creating tables and execute SQL Queries
3) Files System - We can write and read data either to removable storage, such as a Secure Digital card (SD card) or nonremovable storage
4) Over the network - Any remote data source that we can access. We can us API of different app for storing data.

Shared Preferences.:
In this method, we get a particular preferences files from our app data folder. We then edit it with Editor. Now we can save data to this file with key. Then we need to commit the changes for saving it the chosen file. When we need to read data, again we need to edit the file and get the data using key name.
